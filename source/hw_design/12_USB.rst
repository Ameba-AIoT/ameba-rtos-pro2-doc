Differential pair: USB_DP, USB_DM must meet below requirements.

1. Differential impedance must to meet 90 ohms requirements.

2. Length matching: length differential between each pair must under 100 mils, length differential between P and N must under 50 mils.

3. Total via number of each trace must under 4.

4. Proper reference plane: high speed signal trace must have proper reference plane.

5. Suggest to add TVS on USB connector for ESD protection.

Reminder: Reserve USB connector for Image quality tuning
